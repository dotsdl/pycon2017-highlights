# Highlights from PyCon 2017

A short talk delivered to the Beckstein Lab offering up highlights from PyCon 2017 (with links!).

## How to view

This talk can be generated from the ``slides.md`` file using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), a markdown-to-slides generator that uses Reveal. You can also view the ``_static`` files directly in a browser. For example, using Chrome from a shell:

    chrome _static/index.html

## Acknowledgments

A special thanks to Oliver Beckstein (@orbeckst) for funding this trip, and for supporting my involvement in Python development over the years.
